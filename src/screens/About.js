                    The SDM Lab is a research lab at Georgia Institute of Technology (GIT) that is dedicated to the study of
                    Sustainable Design. This project focuses on the development and application a new resillience metric proposed
                    in the paper "A New Resilience Metric to Compare System of Systems Architecture" by Bryan C. Watson, Ashray Chowdhry, Marc J. Weissburg, and Bert Bras.
                    The new metric, SoSRM, is a series of extensive mathematical models and computations that result in the first truly quantitative measure of how resilient 
                    a system is to unexpected disruptions. This can be thought of as a flow-break in a network, such as a power outage that shuts off trains in certain areas out
                    of an entire transportation network. Resilient systems have a higher chance of surviving such disruptions, and preserving resource allocation more closely to the behavior
                    of a steady state system. Conversely, non-resilient systems have a lower chance of surviving such disruptions, and are more likely to have factors in that system reach zero resource allocation.

                    Another extensively studied domain is Ecological Network Analysis (ENA), which is a method for constructing and analyzing metrics that give insight into several characteristics of an ecosystem.
                    Previous work done by Marc J. Weissburg and Bert Bras has shown that ENA can be used to predict the resilience of a system without undergoing the extensive calculation modelling that SoSRM requires.
                    By synthesizing the findings of these two separate domains of work, efficient and accurate insights into resillinece of human-made systems can be analyzed in depth, and recommendations for quantitative 
                    improvement can be made.
                </p>
                <p className='homepage-text'>
                   The purpose of this tool is to allow systems developers from all domains to leverage the significance of SoSRM and ENA to improve the resilience of their systems. Utilizing the newly quantifiable concept of resilience,
                   as well as the application of ENA towards human-made systems, this tool takes in an input system and calculates several ENA metrics that have been shown to highly correlate with SoSRM. These metrics serve as indicators,
                   which in turn provide recommendations for how to improve the system's resilience. We hope to resultingly provide a tool that applies recent systems analysis publications towards helping improve resilience in systems in 
                   interpretable and simple ways.
